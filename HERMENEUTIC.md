# A hermeneutic for interpreting Jesus' parables

This hermeneutic is based on that presented in
[Guidelines for Interpreting Jesus' Parables, Mark L. Bailey, Bibliotheca Sacra 155: 617 (1998): 29-38](https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_parables_bailey.html).

1. Explore the historical-cultural context
2. Identify the need for the parable.
  - Is the purpose implied or explicitly stated?
  - Does the parable respond to a question, complaint or request?
  - Is the parable given because of Israel's rejection of Jesus as Messiah?
  - Does the parable follow an exhortation or principle?
  - Does the parable illustrate a situation?
3. Analyse the structure and details of the parable.
  - Details may be there to help set the scene or point towards the central
    truth of the parable, and don't always need an allegorical interpretation.
4. State the central truth of the parable and its relationship to the Kingdom.
5. Respond to the central truth of the parable.
