# Jesus' Parables

This is a repo for reading Jesus' parables.

This follows a rough [hermeneutic](./HERMENEUTIC.md), and we have a
[template](./worksheet_template.md) to follow to produce a worksheet for every parable we
read.

## Parables covered

### Luke

* [The Good Samaritan, 10:25-37](./worksheets/luke_10_25-37.md)
